## The Basics of Responsive Web Design (RWD)

--

> Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the userâ€™s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.

#### How do we this?

Media Queries

```css
.grid {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}
@media(min-width: 600px) {
    .grid {
        flex-direction: row;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
    }
    .grid > * {
        width: 50%;
    }
}
@media(min-width: 800px) {
    .grid > * {
        width: 33.333%;
    }
}
```
See _[Using Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)_ for a more detailed spec

#### What's this actually doing?

Across all devices (note: no media query), we add this ruleset

 ```css
.grid {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}
```

When the screen >= 600px wide, we _also_ add these rulesets

```css
@media(min-width: 600px) {
    .grid {
        flex-direction: row;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
    }

    .grid > * {
        width: 50%;
    }
}
```

--

#### What are the net styles at this point?

screen width \>= 600px

```css
.grid {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.grid > * {
    width: 50%;
}
```

screen width \>= 800px

```css
.grid {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.grid > * {
    width: 33.333%;
}
```

--

#### A note on specificity

Media queries do **not** add specificty.

```css

.grid {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}

@media(min-width: 600px) {
    .grid {
        flex-direction: row;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
    }
}
```
Each instance of `.grid` have equal specificity. So why does the one in the media query win?


Note:

In CSS, when two things have equal specificity, the last one wins

## Mobile First

1. Start by building the UI for the smallest screen you plan to support (typically phones)
2. Upon completion, incrementally expand your device size (both width _and_ height) until it warrants a change (read: add a media query here)
3. Rinse and repeat step 2 until you've reached desktop size
4. Call it a day (not really)

--

### Why mobile first?

* **Constraints**: When developing, its easier to loosen constraints as you build rather than adding them after the fact. Small screen = most constrained. Large scree = least constrained
* **Priorities**: Small screens force you to consider what matters most to customers/business. 
* **Performance**: Starting mobile first makes it much easier to consider bandwidth constraints and slower device performance (_think_ low powered devices on poor 3G connections)

> Small screen sizes force you to prioritize what really matters to your customers and business. There simply isnâ€™t room for anything else. Slow connections and limited data plans require you to â€œbe vigilant about performance, resulting in fast-loading websites everywhere.

### Let's look at some code again

Mobile First

```css
.grid {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}
@media(min-width: 600px) {
    .grid {
        flex-direction: row;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
    }
    .grid > * {
        width: 50%;
    }
}
@media(min-width: 800px) {
    .grid > * {
        width: 33.333%;
    }
}
```

Desktop First (3 more lines of code)
```css
.grid {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
}
.grid > * {
    width: 33.333%;
}
@media(max-width: 799px) {
    .grid > * {
        width: 50%;
    }
}
@media(max-width: 599px) {
    .grid {
        flex-direction: column;
        flex-wrap: nowrap;
    }
    .grid > * {
        width: 100%;
    }
}
```

### Using SCSS

```scss
.grid {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;

    @media(min-width: 600px) {
        flex-direction: row;
        flex-wrap: wrap;

        .grid > * {
            width: 50%;
        }
    }
    @media(min-width: 800px) {
        .grid > * {
            width: 33.333%;
        }
    }
}
```

### Tip

Write your media queries _with_ your responsive components. Do not write them all at the end of some massive CSS document.
